Here’s a concise explanation of each step in the agent mapping flowchart:

1. **Enumerate files in 'runtime-files/vscode'**  
   List all files in the specified directory.

2. **Identify supported agent files (.ts, .js)**  
   Filter for TypeScript and JavaScript files that could define agents.

3. **For each agent file:**  
   Loop through each identified agent file.

4. **Read file contents**  
   Load the contents of the file into memory.

5. **Extract concepts and branches**  
   Parse the file to find agent concepts (e.g., keywords, metadata) and branch structures.

6. **Compute tokens for content**  
   Tokenize the extracted content for similarity or indexing.

7. **Add agent to manifest/index**  
   Record the agent’s metadata and tokens in a manifest or index structure.

8. **Output manifest.csv and enriched files**  
   Write the manifest (e.g., as CSV) and optionally output enriched agent files with extracted metadata.
